You are given an input file containing a list of words. You are expected to write a program that check whether the words in the file are “anagrams” of a palindrome. If they are, then your program needs to output the word and its one palindrome anagram.
 
Definitions :
Anagram of a word, is obtained by re-arranging the letters in the word. For example, “dad” and “add” are anagrams.
 
Palindromes are words that read the same from left to right and right to left. Example, “dad”, “malayalam”.
 
You are expected to develop a linear time complexity algorithm with minimal space complexity. Only linear algorithms would give you more than 20/40  for the choice of DS and algorithms.
 
The maximum length of each word is 5000 characters. You can assume that  only alphabets[a-z] are present in the input strings.
 
The number of strings in the input file is limited 10000.
